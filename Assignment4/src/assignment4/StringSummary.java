 * Implement a program that takes a string from input and returns it in summary
 * form. That is, if it has several identical consecutive characters, write one
 * character and then write the number of repetitions of that character. If the
 * number of repetitions is 1, there is no need to mention the number 1. Note
 * that, the letterâ€™s case matter.
