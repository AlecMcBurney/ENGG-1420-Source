 * Implement a Date class for the concept of date. Each date object contains year, month and day.
 * Further, each date object must have the following methods:
 *  a. print, that prints the value of the date in the output.
 *  b. addDays, which takes a parameter n of type int and adds n days to the date.
 *  c. compare, which takes a parameter of type Date and calculates the number of days between the
 *      date of the current object and the input object.
